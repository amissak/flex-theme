Most often, it happens several months after the event has taken place. While Telogen Effluvium is mainly caused by stress, it can also be caused by poor diet, sudden weight loss, Menopause, and other underlying health conditions. It is considered to be the second most common cause of hair loss, second to Androgenetic Alopecia and it typically is reversible.<\/p>","show__sym":false,"specialized__sym_title":"","specialized__sym_content":"","specialized__how_title":"HOW CAN ST.

I'm 32 who has blonde, fine (typically) thick hair. After abruptly coming off of hormonal birth control because I noticed receding and thinning hair, I continued to lose more. To remedy, I've tried so many different hair vitamins since October, 2020 and either didn't notice anything happening, or had adverse effects to the ingredients. From so much continual disappointment, I even began to doubt St. Tropica until I looked at my before photos and realized these have helped tremendously. I took a deeper look at the front forehead line of my hair (where I first lost hair from birth control) and I have soooo many more new hairs growing. I have been parting sections of hair around my crown too to apply another serum product for strengthening follicles where I've lost 75% of my density because of telogen effluvium, and I FINALLY see hair sprouting through there too! I have to believe it's because of these vitamins. And I'm not even done with my 60 days yet. Please listen to the reviews. If it ends up not working for you, you can get your money back and put that towards another product. I'm going to continue these vitamins because they're working and it shows in my confidence now. I even bought a bottle for my 60 year old mom who has very fine, thin, brittle hair (who'd been starting to see more of her scalp and had been feeling less confident), and she is almost done with her 60-days and told me all her friends have started complimenting how beautiful her hair looks (and she hasn't gotten compliments on her hair since she was much younger). So it's working for her too!","review__Count3":"true","ch_review_img3":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Gabriela_M.png","title3":"I will continue to use this product","heading3":"Gabriela M","ch_review_content3":"I want to start off by saying that this product works.

My hair was thinning and this did not help with stress. I heard about St. Tropica products on social media and decided to give it a try. I had no side effects pill Is easy to swallow and let me tell you it works. Though Iâ€™m still not out of the woods with my TE itâ€™s really exciting to see the regrowth and really has helped me with stressing less as I see a light at the end of the tunnel.

You can see from the photos my hair growth from November to January, then hair growth from January to now! Not even exaggerating, 1 WEEK after starting them, my hair fall slowed significantly!

I noticed really intense thinning at the very front of my middle part. I was already taking a hair vitamin but as time went on I noticed the thinning becoming much worse and all over rather than just in one spot. My blood work is normal so Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s some form of Telogen Effluvium (basically stress induced). About two months ago when my other hair vitamin ran out, I decided to try St Tropica because of all of the great reviews and PROOF of pics. Iâ€™m happy to say that I am starting to notice some of the thinning is filling in and Iâ€™m not losing quite as much in the shower. Iâ€™m stilling having hair fall which doesnâ€™t help with the stress, but Iâ€™m hoping if I continue to take these vitamins I will have more improvement. I will say that the quality of my hair has drastically improved. Before these vitamins my hair was dry and damaged from bleaching, now it feels a bit healthier."}}},"block_order":["ba895ec7-3287-4c57-b3c8-076ee0344b7f","cbcbed37-1a0b-49ad-be9d-812edc7135af"],"settings":{"specialized__review_title":"REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL RESULTS","width":"wide","padding_top":60,"padding_bottom":0,"padding_left":0,"padding_right":0,"animation":"none","css_class":"","css_id":"","custom_css":""}},"164864287453c7f8d9":{"type":"index__featured-product","blocks":{"164864287420959887-0":{"type":"title","settings":{}},"164864287420959887-1":{"type":"price","settings":{"display_savings":true}},"164864287420959887-3":{"type":"form","settings":{"show_payment_button":true}}},"block_order":["164864287420959887-0","164864287420959887-1","164864287420959887-3"],"settings":{"affiliate_code":"telogen","featured_product":"st-tropica-hair-vitamins-hair-challenge-2-month-supply","product_images_position":"left","set_product_height":false,"product_height":500,"video_looping":false,"gallery_arrows":true,"enable_zoom":true,"enable_product_lightbox":true,"slideshow_speed":0,"slideshow_transition":"slide","display_thumbnails":true,"thumbnail_position":"left-thumbnails","enable_thumbnail_slider":true,"width":"wide","padding_top":60,"padding_bottom":0,"animation":"none","css_class":"","custom_css":".product-gallery__main, .product-gallery__thumbnails.is-slide-nav--true {\n    opacity: 1;\n}"}},"164864161709cc9c7d":{"type":"specialized__page_faqs","blocks":{"2196180a-fb49-4d68-93fa-c36e6716e102":{"type":"specialized__faqs","settings":{"heading":"WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TELOGEN EFFLUVIUM AND ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA?","specialized__faqs_ans":"<p>In women, Androgenetic Alopecia is a form of chronic Telogen Effluvium.<\/p>\n                        <p>However, in men, Telogen Effluvium and Androgenetic Alopecia show different patterns of\n                            balding which differentiates themselves from one another. <\/p>\n                        <p>In men, Telogen Effluvium results in a thinning of hair all over the head.
