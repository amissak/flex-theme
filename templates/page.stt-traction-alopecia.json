Hair thinning that occurs from hairstyles that rub on the hair and result in hair damage or hair loss is typically known as Traction Alopecia.<\/p>\n<p>While most cases of Traction Alopecia are resolved once an individual stops styling their hair in a restrictive way, some can cause permanent follicle damage. Unfortunately, once hair follicles become damaged they cannot grow hair, or the hair that does grow from those follicles may be negatively affected and become thinner than previously.<\/p>\n<p>Hair breakage is a common issue that occurs from hair styling or hair treatments, and this issue is not one that is permanent. Hair breakage happens when the hair strands become weak at a certain point on the hair shaft and break off under stress. Stopping the use of damaging hair styles and supporting your hair's health and strength will allow your hair to recover and grow back.<\/p>\n<p>If you begin to notice your hair is breaking, or that you are noticing thinning or bald spots, you should stop styling your hair in any restrictive styles immediately to limit the amount of damage.<\/p>","faqs__expand":"false"}},"706f19cc-7006-4f49-9e6d-b3e0a89bcfcf":{"type":"specialized__faqs","settings":{"heading":"How to Support Hair Recovery After Hair Styling Damage:","specialized__faqs_ans":"<p>Hair loss, thinning, and breakage caused by hair styling are oftentimes temporary and hair health can be recovered using more protective hair styling methods and by implementing a few best practices to best support your hair health and growth.<\/p>\n<p>Best hair care practices:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul-disc\">\n<li>Use gentle hair care and avoid harsh ingredients such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/blogs\/st-tropica\/why-using-paraben-free-hair-products-is-so-important\" title=\"why you should use paraben free products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/blogs\/st-tropica\/why-using-paraben-free-hair-products-is-so-important&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1655914213724000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ffVQR3fQnrzXoWglHGYA4\">parabens<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/blogs\/st-tropica\/why-using-phthalate-free-products-is-so-important\" title=\"why you should avoid using phthalates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/blogs\/st-tropica\/why-using-phthalate-free-products-is-so-important&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1655914213724000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ru6yuwIQEpIvF-I3QIAJm\">phthalates<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/blogs\/st-tropica\/why-going-sulfate-free-is-the-best-thing-for-your-hair\" title=\"why you need to avoid sulfates in hair care\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/blogs\/st-tropica\/why-going-sulfate-free-is-the-best-thing-for-your-hair&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1655914213724000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3M3stemGr3yFcnQa8VKGh1\">sulfates<\/a>, and artificial fragrances.<\/li>\n\n<li>Support your hair health and growth with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/collections\/st-tropica-collection\/products\/st-tropica-hair-vitamins-hair-challenge-2-month-supply\" title=\"Tru Bloom Hair Growth Vitamins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.sttropica.com\/collections\/st-tropica-collection\/products\/st-tropica-hair-vitamins-hair-challenge-2-month-supply&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1655914213724000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ht6WoXWU9cB4mWvdS-2-d\">Tru Bloom Vitamins<\/a>.
