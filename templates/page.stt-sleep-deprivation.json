It's important to work with your doctor to best address these sleep conditions so that you can improve your quality of sleep.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Personal habits:<\/strong> Being a night-owl, socializing until quite late, or drinking coffee after dinner are just a few examples of personal habits that can affect your quality of sleep and contribute to sleep deprivation. If you feel your habits are impacting your quality of sleep, it may be time to make some changes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Illness:<\/strong> It can be challenging to sleep when you're congested, have a cold or flu, or cough. As you recover from your cold, your sleep schedule should return to normal. If you are struggling to recover from your cold or flu then we recommend visiting your doctor so that they can look into the best steps to alleviate your symptoms and address the root of the problem, as you may require medication or care.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Work:<\/strong> Challenging work schedules can negatively affect your sleep and sleep cycles. If you're required to do shift work, night shifts, or are required frequently to travel then you may find yourself feeling more tired and sleep deprived.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Stress and Anxiety:<\/strong> Feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and anxious often affects sleep. As thoughts or concerns keep you up late at night, you may notice yourself experiencing sleep deprivation symptoms during the day. We recommend you speak to a doctor or a mental health care professional to begin learning best practices to deal with stress and anxiety.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Becoming a new parent:<\/strong> New parents are often quite sleep deprived as they undertake a new schedule of caring, feeding, and comforting a new addition to their family.
