This most often occurs when the body does not have enough iron, and this is known as iron-deficiency Anemia.<\/p><p>Red blood cells contain hemoglobin which is an iron-rich protein that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. When your body does not have enough iron, red blood cells cannot effectively perform their functions.<\/p><p>The primary job of red blood cells is to carry oxygen (hemoglobin) from the lungs to the body and to carry carbon dioxide away from the body and back to the lungs to be expelled as waste. When the body does not have enough functioning red blood cells to perform this vital action, a person will begin to experience a number of symptoms.<\/p><p>There are a few different types of Anemia and every type of Anemia causes red blood cell levels to drop. Here are a few reasons red blood cell levels may become low:<\/p><p>- Your hemoglobin does not function properly<br\/>- Your body cannot make enough red blood cells<br\/>- Your body cannot produce enough hemoglobin, resulting in low hemoglobin<\/p>","show__sym":false,"specialized__sym_title":"","specialized__sym_content":"","specialized__how_title":"HOW CAN ST.
