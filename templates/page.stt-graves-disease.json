Then in the summer I had to under go through Radioactive Iodine Therapy to address my Grave’s Disease.  Then shortly after my Radioactive Iodine Therapy, my TSH shot way up.  Needless to say, both underactive and overactive thyroid issues causes hairloss. And for folks with Graves’ Disease we are not able to take most hair supplements out there, as they have certain ingredients that we need to stay away from, ie: seaweed and kelp.  So, I did some research online and I stumbled upon St. Tropica. I cannot say enough great things about St. Tropica supplements.  I have been taking these supplements since March, 2021 and I can tell you it has helped me tremendously with hair growth during my ongoing thyroid issues. For me I am no so much interested in how fast my hair can grow, but rather prevent any balding as a result of my thyroid issues and treatments. There is no doubt in my mind that I would have had increasing thinning hair and possivle bald spots if it were not St. Tropica hair supplements.  In recent days I even bought a bottle for my daughter-in-law who has PCOS and has been losing hair as a result.  She has been taking the supplements for about 1 month now and we all have noticed baby hairs coming in. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for an amazing product and having it at such an affordable price compared to what is out there.  Just need you guys to start making shampoos and conditioners.","width":"wide","padding_top":60,"padding_bottom":20,"padding_left":0,"padding_right":0,"review__side":"order-0","animation":"none","css_class":"","css_id":"review2","custom_css":".trubloom_review_bg{\n    background-image: url(https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0818\/8965\/t\/96\/assets\/trubloom_review_bg_1.png?v=1648728108);\n    background-size: cover;\n}\n.trubloom_review_bg .purchase-details__buttons .action_button.action_button--secondary {\n    border: 1px solid #ff9ac6;\n    color: #ffffff;\n    background: #ff9ac6;\n}"}},"1649999616b8362c52":{"type":"custom-liquid","settings":{"custom_liquid":"<div id=\"stamped-main-widget\" class=\"mx-0 mb-0\" data-keyword=\"Graves\"><\/div>\n<a href=\"\/products\/st-tropica-hair-vitamins-hair-challenge-2-month-supply?ref=graves\" class=\"button mx-auto\">Order Now<\/a>\n<style>\ndiv.stamped-container[data-widget-style], div[data-widget-style] div.stamped-container {\n    margin: 0px auto!important;\n}\n<\/style>"}}},"order":["164872987662732b2c","16486356205a406201","1655961790a571e76d","1648640448df60772a","16641882053c9e3316","164864287453c7f8d9","164864161709cc9c7d","1649999616b8362c52"]}
