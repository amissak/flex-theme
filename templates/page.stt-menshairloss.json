They include:<\/p>\n<p><b>QUIT SMOKING:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Hair loss experienced by both men and women can be caused by smoking. Long term smoking damaged the hair follicle\n    which causes the hair to become thinner and weaker. In addition, smoking restricts healthy blood flow which\n    slows hair growth. For men, this can cause premature Male Pattern Baldness.<\/p>\n<p><b>REVIEW YOUR MEDICATIONS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There are a number of medications on the market that can contribute to hair loss and hair thinning. Here are a\n    few that are known to cause hair loss:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul-disc\">\n    <li>Thyroid medications<\/li>\n    <li>Weight loss drugs<\/li>\n    <li>Acne medications containing retinoids<\/li>\n    <li>Antibiotics<\/li>\n    <li>Antidepressants<\/li>\n    <li>Anticlotting drugs<\/li>\n    <li>Cholesterol-lowering drugs<\/li>\n    <li>Epilepsy drugs (anticonvulsants)<\/li>\n    <li>High blood pressure medications<\/li>\n    <li>Hormone replacement therapy<\/li>\n    <li>Mood stabilizers<\/li>\n    <li>Steroids<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are experiencing unusual hair loss then it is important to review the medications you are taking with a\n    doctor.<\/p>\n<p><b>MAINTAIN A HEALTHY SLEEP SCHEDULE<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Those who neglect incorporating a healthy sleep schedule into their lives has been proven to have many negative\n    side-effects. While most initially it may cause difficulty concentrating, a foggy memory, and weakened strength,\n    overtime it can also cause a vulnerability to infections, an increased risk of Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease,\n    and hair loss.<\/p>\n<p>While you are sleeping, your body produces melatonin which is a hormone that aids in regulating the bodies sleep\n    cycle and hair growth. If you do not have a normal sleep schedule, this hormone will become unbalanced.<\/p>\n<p><b>REDUCE STRESSORS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Throughout ones life, it is important to manage stress levels for many reasons. Chronic stress can impact almost\n    every system in the body, including: the immune, digestive, reproductive system, and more. It can also affect\n    hair growth over time. Managing stress will improve your overall health and hair growth.<\/p>\n<p>Severe stress caused by a traumatic incident can also interrupt the hair growth cycle causing sudden hair loss.\n    This form of hair loss is known as <a href=\"telogen-effluvium\" data-uw-rm-brl=\"false\">Telogen Effluvium<\/a>.\n    Through stress management, your hair will likely return and grow back to its normal state.<\/p>\n<p><b>HAVE REGULAR SCALP MASSAGES<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Increasing blood flow to the scalp has been shown to increase hair growth. For this reason, we recommend doing\n    hot oil treatments and scalp massages regularly.<\/p>\n<p><b>STOP DAMAGING HAIR TREATMENTS OR STYLES\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Tightly pulled hairstyles or having damaging hair treatments done repeatedly can also cause hair loss. This type\n    of hair loss is called traction hair loss, or traction alopecia, and it can often be reversed. To reverse this\n    kind of hair loss you must stop using damaging hairstyles and treatments.<\/p>\n<p><b>ASSESS YOUR DIET<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Eating a healthy, balanced, and nutritious diet is important for all functions in the body, including hair\n    growth. We recommend assessing your diet with a doctor or nutritionist to find out ways you can improve your\n    health.<\/p>\n<p><b>FIND OUT IF YOU HAVE ANY NUTRITIONAL\n    DEFICIENCIES<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Another reason to assess your diet is to find out about any nutritional deficiencies you may have. Having low\n    B12, Riboflavin, or Biotin levels can cause hair loss. By identifying these deficiencies and adding a supplement\n    into your diet, hair loss can often be reversed.<\/p>","faqs__expand":"false"}},"244d1b76-3e8a-4711-83cd-50ae1f76386d":{"type":"specialized__faqs","settings":{"heading":"Can Vitamins Help with Male Pattern Baldness?","specialized__faqs_ans":"<p>Yes!
