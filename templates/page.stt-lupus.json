Thin, falling out, shedding like crazy, hard to grow, brittle, dry, and dull. Since starting St. Tropica hair vitamins, my hair has done a complete 180 and it has literally changed my life! My hair is growing so fast, it is thicker, shiny, and so much healthier! The thinning around my face is barely noticeable anymore any i receive compliments on my hair now ALL THE TIME! I do want to let people know that you may experience a little \"plateau\" period with your hair growth. I did around my 3rd month. This is completely normal so DO NOT STOP TAKING THESE!! The vitamins are for so much more than just added length! And, after that little plateau in growing, my hair is back to growing like a weed after I got my hair trimmed! I will be a customer for life, and rave about these to everyone I meet! My husband actually just started taking these (well stealing mine lol) 2 weeks ago after he has seen what they have done for my hair, and I'm excited to see what they do for him!
