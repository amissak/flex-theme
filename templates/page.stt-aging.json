These phases indicate the growth, rest, and shedding processes our hair goes through. While these phases remain unchanged throughout our life, the hair they produce may go through some changes as we age.<\/p>\n<p>For example, as we get older our hair often turns gray, white, or silver. While it appears that our hair changes color, this isn't actually the case. If you have brown hair and begin to notice new gray hairs sprouting up, it is because your previously brown hair has gone through the Exogen phase (shedding phase) and been replaced with a new hair that contains less melanin. To better clarify this: you will not, for example, find a hair that is half brunette and half gray.<\/p>\n<p>As we grow in age, the melanin (pigment) in our hair begins to gradually die. That is why typically we begin to see gray hairs grow in gradually, rather than suddenly having a full head of gray, silver, or white hair.<\/p>","faqs__expand":"false"}},"31ba5d6d-c4d4-485f-bac2-87955f469d02":{"type":"specialized__faqs","settings":{"heading":"What Causes Premature Graying of the Hair?","specialized__faqs_ans":"<p>While the predominant cause of graying hair is due to the natural aging process, there are a few health concerns that can cause premature graying of the hair.

As we age, our hair growth rate often slows and hair texture may change and become finer. This can sometimes be due to the aging process affecting the hair follicle and resulting in it shrinking. This means the hair that comes from that follicle will become thinner.
